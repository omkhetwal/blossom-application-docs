# Help My Friend Land a UI Design Role!
Hi everyone!

As you may know, I create YouTube videos about React,React Native development. Today, I want to reach out to my subscribers for help.

My friend Gabriela Arcia is an incredibly talented UI designer who is looking for a new role in the industry. They have about an years of experience working with Figma, and have a portfolio full of amazing designs that showcase their skills.

I know that many of you work in tech or have connections in the industry, and I would be incredibly grateful if you could help my friend land a UI design role. If you know of any companies or individuals who are looking for a talented designer, please share my friend's information with them.

You can find more information about my friend, including their work and contact details, in their [👉🏽 portfolio](https://andreinaarcia.com/).

Thank you so much for your help! Let's work together to help my friend find their dream job.

Many Thanks and Best Regards,
